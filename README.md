# fpga-stream-compiler
Domain-specific FPGA compiler for deterministic streaming pipelines. Converts YAML or natural language intent into validated IR, deterministic SystemVerilog, generated constraints, and automated Vivado builds with closed-loop timing. Eliminates direct HDL for constrained real-time dataflow systems while enforcing structural and timing safety.
